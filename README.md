Web3 wallet platform (HD Wallets)

This project was done for understanding how the blockchain handles wallets and transactions.
It also helped me improve my full-stack application development skills to a great extent.

This was a project idea obtained from a web3 cohort and built using Vite and React.
Additional skills learnt in web2:
- Redux
- Custom Hooks
- Context API

I will keep this repository updated until the user is able to do perform the following:
- User should be able to create multiple accounts.
- User should be able to create multiple wallets in multiple blockchain networks in each account.
- User should be able to make send and receive cryptocurrency.
- User should be able to access the mainnet, devnet and testnet.
